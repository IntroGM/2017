The [Helsinki University Geodynamics Group](http://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/HUGG) is offering a one-week short course titled "Introduction to lithospheric geodynamic modelling" for master's/PhD students and interested researchers.

# Course goals

- Understand the fundamental physical equations solved in numerical geodynamic models, how they work, and how they affect numerical experiments
- Learn how to convert the main equations used to model lithospheric deformation into simple programs
- Develop a background understanding of geodynamics that allows you to properly understand the behavior of geodynamic numerical models

# Learning objectives
At the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Solve partial differential equations using the finite-difference method
- Differentiate between and implement various boundary and initial conditions in numerical models
- Create their own simple 2D numerical geodynamic model including heat transfer and viscous flow

# Suggested background studies
Students taking this course should have

- Basic knowledge of geodynamic processes in the lithosphere (stress and strain, elasticity, viscous flow, plasticity, heat transfer, etc.)
- Familiarity with basic computer programming concepts (loops, conditional statements, etc.)
- General understanding of calculus (derivatives, integrals, etc.)

It is not required, but you will also benefit from having some knowledge of programming in Python.

# Study resources for course preparation
In the event you are not confident you qualify to take this course, please contact the course instructors directly via email.
In addition, you may benefit from studying the following web resources:

- [Geodynamics course video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsSTyHHQVvnGdnKbidSj94A/playlists)
- [Codecademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)
- [Interactive Python tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/)

# Credit points
Helsinki University students will earn 3-5 credit points, depending on whether or not they complete the optional course project (+2 CP) to be completed after the formal course instruction ends.
Students from other universities should check with their home university about the tranfer of credit points.
