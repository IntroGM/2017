This website briefly describes the contents of the Introduction to Lithospheric Geodynamic Modelling course at the University of Helsinki.

# Course goals

- Understand the fundamental physical equations solved in numerical geodynamic models, how they work, and how they affect numerical experiments
- Learn how to convert the main equations used to model lithospheric deformation into simple programs
- Develop a background understanding of geodynamics that allows you to properly understand the behavior of geodynamic numerical models

# Learning objectives
At the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Solve partial differential equations using the finite-difference method
- Differentiate between various boundary and initial conditions applied to numerical models
- Create their own simple 2D numerical geodynamic model including heat transfer and viscous flow

# Suggested background studies
Students taking this course are should have taken past courses that provide

- Basic knowledge of geodynamic processes in the lithosphere (stress and strain, elasticity, viscous flow, plasticity, heat transfer, etc.)
- Familiarity with basic computer programming concepts (loops, logical operators, conditional statements, etc.)
- General understanding of calculus (derivatives, integrals, discretization, etc.)

It is not required, but you will also benefit from having some knowledge of programming in Python.
