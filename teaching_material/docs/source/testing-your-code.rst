Testing your code and benchmarking
==================================

As we have seen yesterday_, it is possible to use the finite difference method to solve equations, and if we use a sufficiently high resolution we can get a very precise solution.
But is it right?
It can be difficult to know without directly comparing our solutions to known correct values.
This process will be the focus of this lesson.
