Heat conduction with advection
==============================

We now have all the tools to implement a "full" one-dimensional
heat transfer equation where we consider

- heat conduction,
- heat advection, 
- heat generation, and
- variable physical paramaters.

.. math::

   \rho(x) \C_p(x) \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + v_x \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \alpha(x) \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right) + H
